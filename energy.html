            <p class="lead">
                As global warming gets more and more serious, to create a better environment for the next
                generation we should really take our responsibility to solve the problem. As we know that the root of
                current climate change is the emission of greenhouse gases, which is mainly intensified by burning
                fossil fuels, it is apparent that replacing them with reusable energy is one of the solutions that hits
                home! The fact is that ocean covers 70 percent of the Earth’s surface, so why not better utilize this
                natural powerhouse to help us alleviate the global warming situation?</p>
            <p class="lead">
                There are different forms of marine energy, including tidal energy, marine current power, and wave
                energy, etc. </p>
            <h3 class="featurette-subheading">Tidal Energy</h3>
            <p class="lead">
                Tidal energy is productive if the tidal energy generators are set in places where the tidal movement is
                high and frequent. Turbines are built under water and rotated by the movements of tides, which generates
                kinetic energy and they are transferred to electrical energy. The energy is generated when the tide
                comes in and out because the turbines work in both directions.</p>
            <h3 class="featurette-subheading">Marine Current Power</h3>
            <p class="lead">
                Similar to tidal energy, marine current power is generated from kinetic energy of strong ocean currents.
                There are two kinds of ocean currents; one is wind driven and the other one is density driven. According
                to Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, for the same surface area, water moving 12 miles per hour exerts
                the same amount of force as a constant 110 mph wind. It means that ocean currents generate a great
                amount of energy.</p>
            <h3 class="featurette-subheading">Wave energy</h3>
            <p class="lead">Wave energy is the kind of energy that is formed by ocean surface waves. Therefore,
                electricity generators are set on the ocean surface. The yield of wave energy depends on the wave speed,
                wave length, wave height, etc. As a result, this energy is higher in windward shores such as western
                coasts in Southern Hemisphere.</p>
            <p class="lead">If marine energy is that sustainable, why don’t we totally replace it with fossil fuels?
                There are still a lot of concerns and disadvantages regarding to these reusable energy. They include
                high initial installation cost, negative effect on marine ecosystem, lower stability, etc. There is
                still a big room for research. However, it is undoubted that these energy are abundant in amount and
                help ease global warming. Therefore, it’s definitely worth to take them seriously.</p>
