                    class="text-muted">Ocean acidification is no lemonade.</span></h2>
            <p class="lead">
                We all know that global warming leads to temperature increase of ocean, which can be a big deal because
                it also results in more ice melting in the Polar Regions and deteriorate the problem even further (look
                up the Albedo page for more details). In addition, global warming is a big culprit of ocean
                acidification.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                Let us take a step back, global warming is driven by greenhouse gas emissions. Among all kinds of
                greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide make up roughly 80 percent of the total. Therefore, global warming is
                greatly affected by the emission of carbon dioxide, so does the ocean, which takes up about 70% of the
                earth surface area.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                According to UCSDâ€™s Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Ocean has absorbed 26% of the carbon dioxide
                produced by burning fuels. It is a major carbon sink in earth, which is a very good thing for human
                because it keeps plenty of CO2 out of the atmosphere. However, when CO2 reacts with seawater, it
                releases hydrogen and therefore increases the acidity of seawater. In fact, the acidity of ocean has
                increased by a third since industrial revolution. If we continue to produce carbon dioxide as what we
                are currently doing, the acidity of seawater will double before 2100.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                The question comes, why does ocean acidification matter? Thousands of ocean creatures form protective
                shells to survive. They make their shells by using molecules called carbonate ions from seawater. With
                the increase of hydrogen ions, the carbonate ions are depleted. Related ocean creatures find it more
                difficult to produce shells, maintain energy to find food, reproduce and survive. To make it short,
                shell-forming animals dissolve when acidity gets very high. One of the specific examples is that the
                life forms like shrimps, lobsters and crabs in the US west coast are at risk because of the acidity
                increase in seawater.</p>
            <p class="lead">At the first glance, it seems to be a problem for only the shell-forming creatures. However,
                it is actually a very serious issue because if the smallest things in the ocean are affected by ocean
                acidification, it ripples all the way up the food web, according to Dr. Palumbi from Stanford
                University. It means that the food web will become more vulnerable. More kinds of ocean creatures will
                be prone to extinction and the marine biodiversity will be harmed.</p>
            <p class="lead">In addition, ocean acidification will negatively affect the living environment for ocean
                creatures. Coral reefs are one of the big victims because they are mainly structured by calcium
                carbonate. Ocean acidification will corrode the structure and put ocean species that live in coral reefs
                (which take up a quarter of the total) in jeopardy.</p>
